What a PIA!\nGreg McGuffey: On a TP note...I have some teams that have been reorged. I would like to disable them to be selected. Is that possible?\nAdam: oh I feel your pain, we just finished our basement this weekend but it needs another coat... As to the TP problem, not really, unlike with projects there isn't a good way to mark a team as inactive\nGreg McGuffey: :(\nGreg McGuffey: (and I'm jealous you have a basement to paint! I miss basements)\nAdam: you could flag the team with a tag or custom field, or you could create a webhook that removed all assignments when updates are triggered, but they're not great options\nAdam: ah all slabs in Arizona too?\nGreg McGuffey: mostly :,(\nGreg McGuffey: ok on teams. Is there anyway to tell when a team was assigned to a story/bug?\nGreg McGuffey: If there is, I can create a view to identify stories assigned to wrong team\nAdam: in the Story/Bug's history there should be an entry with ""Team #xxxxxxxx is assigned\nGreg McGuffey: Yeah, but that would require opening stories. I interested in finding stories assigned to the old teams as of today.\nAdam: ah, okay, so you want a view that will show which stories were assigned to a team before a certain date?\nGreg McGuffey: after a certain date\nGreg McGuffey: Before a certain date, everything is cool\nGreg McGuffey: after that date is problematic...they should be using a new team instead\nAdam: hmm i thought maybe something like this might get you there but it wouldn't get you what you were looking for ?History.Where(Date > '13-Jul-2015' and UserStory.Team.Name is 'Another Team')\nAdam: for the moment I don't think it's possible, more historical data manipulation would be required to generate anything of value\nGreg McGuffey: hmmm ok\nGreg McGuffey: didn't know you could use history in views...that's cool\nAdam: indeed it's possible, but you can't get very complicated with your filters and such\nGreg McGuffey: why won't that filter work?\nGreg McGuffey: ah, that can tell me historically if it was assigned, but it might actually still be assigned right?\nAdam: right, the real problem though is that it won't pick up things that have an entry after the fact\nGreg McGuffey: So, the UserStory.Team.Name bit...does that mean ""The team is currently"" or ""The team was this at time of history"" or ""The history is of the team change""?\nAdam: so if I have an entry 3 days ago where team A is assigned, if I assign to team B 2 days ago it wouldn't pick it up if my filter were for team A\nAdam: I think so actually\nGreg McGuffey: you think what?\nAdam: that that UserStory.Team String is relating to the User Story now rather than as part of the History record\nGreg McGuffey: ah right...makes it less useful in this situation\nGreg McGuffey: OK, I'll probably just use state to deal with this. I.e. if in a current state, shouldn't be on the old team\nGreg McGuffey: i.e. non-finished state\nGreg McGuffey: I have another question: is TP hiring developers? :)\nAdam: makes sense, and right that's the problem with History filters, they're really not robust enough to be useful at the moment\nAdam: yes but the office that does the dev work is in the EU, to my knowledge we don't have any American Dev staff at the moment\nGreg McGuffey: ah, wondered\nGreg McGuffey: You and the other support staff, the blog and the product all piqued my interest ;)\nAdam: ha, indeed it's a great company, I worry I've been spoiled by working here :P\nGreg McGuffey: you're being nurtured, not spoiled ;)\nAdam: a better way to put it, certainly :)\nGreg McGuffey: Thanks Adam!

I used this article to plot the color coded open vs. complete... how do I add a third bar for total\nhttps://www.targetprocess.com/guide/featured/how-to-use-the-visual-reports-editor/\nAdam: can you show me a screenshot of what you have so far? There are a few ways to do it so the answer will depend on how you got to this point\nAdam: hmm still puzzling with it a bit, this editor is fairly new for us as well\nAdam: please bear with me\nShom: sure thing!\nMy issue with it is that if I have User Stories selected as a data source I can't seem to operate on User Stories anymore through formula... and the is Completed formula doesn't look like it should aggregate but it does, so can't use that as an example either.\nAdam: is doable, i filtered for entitystate.name there\nShom: So how do I get a sum of all the Projects (in your example) as another Bar in the series?\nAdam: I understand that isn't what you're looking for, still trying different options\nShom: So from my example:\nI want to see a bar ""Open"" showing 282; ""Completed"" showing ""16"" and a ""Total"" showing 298\nShom: Actually, just realized something... the total number of records should be 305... so I'm not sure why Open+Completed is only 298\nAdam: do you have any filters active in the report?\nShom: No filters, screenshot soon\nAdam: they seem to match here, where are you getting the extra 7 from?\nShom: Look at the dasboard page top left graph which is a bar graph by entity state... those add up to 305.\nAlso, the bottom right which is just count of records for the same project also returns 305\nAdam: okay and you're absolutely sure no other entity types were accidentally included in those reports that have extra?\nShom: I'll check and screenshot\nAdam: I've checked the database and I only see 298 stories in that project though so there must be extra records for some reason, digging a little deeper now\nShom: Thanks for looking, the real bummer is that this isn't even what I wanted to ask ;)\nAdam: have you updated the data recently?\nShom: I literally went back to dashboard and now it's showing 305\nShom: I mean 298\nShom: sorry\nAdam: ah I tried forcing a refresh from my end and I guess it worked :)\nShom: I wasn't sending you stale screenshots, I was going back and forth between reports... the dashboard should have been fresh\nAdam: there should be a link at the bottom of the reports to update the data\nShom: Ah okay, I was worried I was being an idiot somehow\nShom: But no such link on dashboard, right?\nAdam: and the dashboards only pull the data from the reports so they can't trigger an update\nAdam: at least for the moment\nShom: So the dashboards will be only as fresh as the last time someone manually clicked update data on the reports?!\nShom: Ah crap, didn't think it would show you the comment now... don't let it get to your head ;)\nAdam: for now at least, the old interface updated in real time I think the reasoning here is that they wanted to be sure the update method was stable\nAdam: ah, we see that you leave those, but not what they say, so don't worry, but I'm hoping it's not bad :)\nAdam: either way I do appreciate the feedback\nAdam: okay let's get back to your original question\nAdam: I'm starting to doubt that it is possible to show this data all at once without creating a Count(EntityState is....) formula, but it's not allowing me to make one either\nShom: It was good :)\nLet me know if you want to take the count formula as an action item and I can ask couple other things. I'm also fine if you want to work on it now. Your call.\nAdam: hmm, let's table it for now, if it's not a huge rush I'm happy to bother the team again and get back to you on it, their fault for making it so tricky :P there's probably some syntax problem in my formula\nAdam: what else can I help with at the moment?\nShom: Alright cool...\nShom: So next question:\nI would like to generate a report on how long an entity spent in each state... Basically a per-state cycle time. Also how would I plot that?\nAdam: oo that's definitely not possible at the moment, I've been hoping it would be prioritized for a while but it's still only in the planning stages https://tp3.uservoice.com/forums/174654-we-will-rock-you/suggestions/7527826-historical-data-in-custom-graphical-report\nAdam: so currently I can create a report based on any existing current data\nAdam: but I can't create a report on what that data was last week\nShom: Okay, using non-graphical reporting how can I extract that information basically the contents of the Flow tab?\nShom: Flow tab of user story\nAdam: there is a field for last state change date, which will allow you to derive the time in the current state but that's as far back as you can go\nAdam: I'd recommend using the cumulative flow diagram, but that's about as close as we get at the moment\nAdam: other than that there really isn't a great way to extract historical data like that\nShom: But cumulative flow won't tell me what the average amount of time spent in each state is, correct?\nAdam: right, the information is there if you open the history tab of any given story, it just isn't usable by any of the graphical or tabular reporting interfaces at the moment, even if you use a custom tabular report to extract the history of a group of stories you'd some how have to differentiate which entries were the actual state change and which were other changes during which the state was maintained\nShom: ok, I'll look into how I can create a custom tabular report to get the historical data out... let me know if you have any recommendations.\n\nIf not, next question which I'm also expecting a no... Is it possible to do a report (burn down/velocity type) based on number of entities as opposed to effort and timespent?\nAdam: If you use User Story History as the data source and have Entity State as one of the columns if they're in chronological order you'll know when each state was changed\nShom: Basically, how quickly are we getting user stories done, regardless of effort we put in (some projects aren't using effort at all)\nShom: Awesome, thanks for that.\nAdam: because of the inability to report on past events it's not possible to create a burn-down using the graphical reporting interface currently, right\nAdam: no problem\nShom: You're finally killing me... I'll look into the history and see if I can create velocity based on the state transitions... \nDo I have any options to bring that report back into TP?

I'll have to put a step into add up all the same state entries for a given entity for the average to make sense\nShom: But for this process we're okay\nAdam: right, in principle that should still be fine\nAdam: I'm glad it's working, still though it shouldn't be necessary to do all that",2018-05-29,Adam Ross,belcansssbu.tpondemand.com,,00332000029d1B6AAI,On-Demand,,https://my.livechatinc.com/archives/OGESKZCY9P,Shom,9,79,OGESKZCY9P,986.3013699,0013200001H1QrUAAV,2016-11-17,manager,"87,90,84,93,97,95,73,93,86,80,90,83",50,Customer,24374.83,"""2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z""",Tucson Generator Team Member,14,Customer,,Chat,LiveChat,135116,Other,shom@belcan.com,Tandel Systems (Belcan),7.142857143,2016-11-01,,,,,,,

First off, I LOVE the new reporting. so great\nTrevor Geisler: I just have a couple questions on how to get it working for our team\nTrevor Geisler: I'm looking to make a report that shows how many user stories were completed in a sprint PER assigned team\nBogdan: Do you want to have them for multiple teams or for 1 team only?\nTrevor Geisler: Multiple. \nBogdan: Let me try to build it locally\nTrevor Geisler: mmk cool. this is what I have so far, but I seem to be missing quite a few user stories. \nBogdan: But as i understand you want a number of completed user stories, right?\nTrevor Geisler: I'm sorry, the END GOAL is to get the amount of effort from those user stories. I'm attempting to have a ""yesterday's weather"" sort of setup \nTrevor Geisler: to where we can see our velocity at a team-level, due to how specific our work is. I know it's a bit out of the scrum philosophy. :S\nBogdan: So now you're missing some stories in there. Can you try to use AssignedTeam instead of ResponsibleTeam for coloring bars?\nTrevor Geisler: hmm, seems to still be the same. \nBogdan: Let's try to dig into this. What are you missing in there?\nBogdan: Because setup looks ok from the first sight\nBogdan: Maybe it's related to chosen project/team in selector?\nTrevor Geisler: I think I may have found it -- It looks like the user stories that were not  showing up were incorrectly set up by the user assigned to them\nTrevor Geisler: that makes so much more sense! \nBogdan: Glad to hear that!\nTrevor Geisler: Ok, so this should be right if all of our information is correct. May I ask why we should use assigned team instead of responsible? \nTrevor Geisler: This is how we were making sure the right team is 'responsible' by the end time we hit the finish stage. I don't know know if that's how our workflows should look, but it was affecting our burndown \nBogdan: Assigned Team will show all the teams which are assigned to the entity\nBogdan: While responsible will show only one which is in charge of the current specific user story state\nBogdan: It depends what exactly information do you want to get\nTrevor Geisler: hmm ok. \nBogdan: I just meant that assignment is wider therefore was thinking that this is the cause of your issue\nTrevor Geisler: right, awesome. \nTrevor Geisler: thank you for the help! can't promise I won't have more questions later today.

,,chat-OFRQR53QUL,2016-12-29,I am trying to create a report that shows the total effort for each person in a sprint. I want the effort to be divided by the number of people assigned to the story as we sometimes have multiple resources on a story and need a true sum of the effort by person.,"Adam: Hi! Thank you for reaching out, I'll be glad to assist\nVahid Mousavi: I am using the new Create report feature and have selected the Effort Assigned to a person by project template.\nAdam: I see, for the moment there isn't a good way to tell the system to react to Assigned Effort this way, does your team use time entries?\nVahid Mousavi: The sum of points currently shows the total sum of all stories assigned to a person regardless of number of people assigned to a single story, which is skewing my results. E.g. I have story with 8 points assigned to two people, so the sum per person for that story should be 4 and not 8. How do I get the report to show the true points assigned when a story has more than one person assigned?\nVahid Mousavi: We don't use time entries for all projects.\nVahid Mousavi: Time entries would be useful for project plans, and not for sprint planning and effort allocation using points.\nAdam: the problem is that you'd need to somehow incorporate if logic into the report axis, ie. SUM(Effort) and IIF AssignedUser.Count == 2, Effort/2 and IIF AssignedUser.Count ==3, Effort/3\nAdam: but that isn't supported at the moment, Time entries on the other hand are assigned on a User by User basis\nVahid Mousavi: Let me try that. we don't often have more than 2 people, so this may be a good workaround.\nAdam: sorry I'm saying it can't be done currently\nAdam: if your team uses time, assuming User A and User B have a story with 5 hours of effort one might complete 3 hours and another may complete 2 and the Time Spent values would naturally follow\nVahid Mousavi: Actually, if we were using the Agile process correctly, we should only be worried about team velocity and not points assigned to a person anyway,\nAdam: indeed that's part of the reason there isn't support for this yet, Targetprocess primarily focuses on agile methodology hence the lack of Gantt charts for example\nVahid Mousavi: I just tried typing in the following formula, and it gave me the same results as before: SUM(Effort) and IIF AssignedUser.Count ==2, Effort/2\nAdam: right the system doesn't support that sort of logic as an axis currently, I was saying it would need to for this to work\nVahid Mousavi: Oh. Ok. I think for now, we probably will need to create separate stories by person to get around this issue.\nAdam: rather I'd recommend using Tasks for this purpose\nAdam: there's a setting you can turn on that makes User Story effort a simple sum of Task Effort\nAdam: so you can separate your Stories into Tasks and assign a single Task to each person\nVahid Mousavi: Yes. We really should have everyone estimate their tasks by hours and then make sure they are not over-allocated based on number of available time in the sprint.\nAdam: exactly, you've got it :)\nVahid Mousavi: That's I have used in the past with Rally :)\nAdam: fair enough, I hope you have a good experience doing the same here, and if you have any feedback please share it with us\nVahid Mousavi: Thanks for your help.\nAdam: any time Vahid, have a great afternoon!\nVahid Mousavi: you too",2018-04-09,Danielle Maier,taxresources.tpondemand.com,,00332000029d1CQAAY,On-Demand,,https://my.livechatinc.com/archives/OFRQR53QUL,Vahid Mousavi,3,43,OFRQR53QUL,650,0016000000cJje7AAC,2016-10-27,,"100,100,93,100,90,100,79,100,100,100,100,88",26,Customer,46597.53,"""2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z""",,10,Customer,,Chat,LiveChat,21787,Other,vahid.mousavi@taxaudit.com,"TaxResources, Inc.",6.3,2011-06-22,,,,,,,

For example, if a bug was created on 9/2/2016 and Archive on 9/7/2016 and a report was run for the date range of 9/1/2016 through 9/8/2016 that is bug would count as 0 for 9/1, 1 for 9/2, 9/3, 9/4, 9/5, 9/6, and 9/7, and 0 for 9/8.  Make sense?\nRichard VanSickle: and have that aggregated for all open bugd\nRichard VanSickle: bugs\nAndrey: Yes, sure. But I`m afraid it`s not possible so far. You can only display how many bugs were created on particular date and how many of them have certain severity.

Is it a payed feature?\nAdam: not directly, it is possible to use REST API to get various records, but nothing historical at the moment, I can check with the team and see if it may be possible to send query results to you on request but this would be a slow process and I am not sure that dev ops would allow us to do this\nFabio Lima: Yeah... I need it on a regular basis though...\nFabio Lima: Oh well, too bad, thanks anyway Adam\nAdam: you could generate a User Story History Report using the Tabular reporting interface\nFabio Lima: Mmmm...

As well as it is not possible to show the historical data in graphical reports\nwale: Ok. In what way do you suggest to create graph (or burn down)?\nNatalia: That is a difficult question. If you used native fields to fill in story points, you would have been able to see standard burn down report which is available under Reports menu in the top bar. Our table custom reports allow to have some kind of history reports, but unfortunately, history for custom fields is not available there. So, there is no good way to build such report. The only 'solution' is to periodically export data to CSV file, and using  Excel magic build the report.

Here is the scenario. Our initial effort estimates are turning out to be absolutely incoherent with our actual efforts. As a result we are in need of a report that somehow shows us something like\n1. Report for Estimated Effort  Vs Actual Effort\na. Task Wise\nb. User Story wise\nc.  Feature Wise\nIt would be great if the report can highlight the part of the graph where there was maximum deviation from estimated effort.\nThe report should also mention the name of the developer/s for the task\n2.   Report for Developer Productivity\nA report that shows how close the developer works to the estimates + Number of bugs reported for the task.\n3.  Punctuality Report\nA report that shows developer wise punctuality and timeliness in updating target process. this report should answer the questions like\na. Does the user change the status of current task to in progress before starting to add time.\nb. How often does the developer add time in the back date for its task\nc. The correct way of updating your timesheets is to spend last 30 minutes of your office time filling the timesheets. So it maynot be a good idea to make sporadic updates rather updates must be done around the same time. It would be good if the report can show if the developer is using TP properly or making sporadic updates.\nI know it would be too much. But i find these very important.\nRegards,\nRaghave\nraghav.shukla.porteo@gmail.com",2017-09-22,,porteo.tpondemand.com,,00332000028s4lKAAQ,,1,https://plan.tpondemand.com/entity/133432,Raghav Shukla,9,97,133432,,0013200001Hf5THAAZ,2016-03-20,"developer,manager","20,20,75,16,10,28,96,59,95,90,66",5,Prospect,,"""2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z""",,1,Lead,Architect,In-app,UX Google Group,103495,Other,raghav.shukla.porteo@gmail.com,Porteo,8,,,,,,,,
